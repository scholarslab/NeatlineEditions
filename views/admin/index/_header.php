/**
 * Header partial template for logo, nav, and add button. For the navigation, the
 * template uses raw markup instead of the nav() helper because of an inflexibility
 * in the is_current_uri() function, which in this situation interprets the
 * 'neatline-exhibits' route as being active in all three cases, which causes the
 * 'Neatlines' tab to have the current class in all cases, which is not appropriate.
